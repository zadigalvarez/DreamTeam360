Help: The Network Analysis Program is designed to create a list of required paths to be completed by the user after accepting a number of inputs. Inputs come in the form of an activity name, a duration, and a list of dependencies. The NAP will use these inputs to create paths, which show the total duration for each, as well as all activity names along the path. 

To use, enter an activity name and duration. If the activity's start is dependent on other processes' completion, enter the name of the dependencies, separated by commas. To add additional activities, select "Add Another Activity". To view the possible outcomes, select "Generate Paths". To start over, select "Restart". To close the program, select "Quit".
